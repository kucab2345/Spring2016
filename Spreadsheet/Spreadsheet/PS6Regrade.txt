I made one simple mistake way back in PS2 that finally surfaced as a result of
a specification in PS6.

In my Formula constructor, I made a charArray of the exact formula as it was passed into the constructor.
I used it to check the first and last characters of the Formula to make their they were valid, ie a (, number, letter.
However, in PS6, the professor added the specification that all formulas would need to be preceeded by the = char, which
was actually not problematic in-and-of itself. 

I strip off the = char before sending it to the formula constructor, so again, my constructor would see the very next character, 
be it a number or letter or (. The problem was that the professor's tests have a space immediately after the = char. In my tests, I had
no space after the = signs.

For example, the professor might have "= A1 + 100" as a formula. I wrote mine as "=A1+100". That whitespace caused my constructor to throw
an invalid name error for almost every test as whitespace is not a valid starting character. I switched it to check the first character of the
tokens after they have been parsed, removing white space entirely. 

3 lines of code changed (2 for checking the end and beginning of the string respectively, and one to check the length of the string) to correct
33 failed tests.
