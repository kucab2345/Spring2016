I made two mistakes when submitting PS5

The first mistake was that I had the order of ToUpper and isValid
switched in each of my functions. Since the names had to be case-insensitive,
I thought it was appropriate to first lower the incoming name and then
check it's validity. That failed if the name coming in was invalid. Since I
tried lowering the string before checking that it was valid, the tests often 
bombed.

This fixed all but 2 tests. (See the history of branch PS5 commit titled "Only failing two tests" to see these changes)
Also note that I originally used ToLower and changed it to ToUpper, for aesthetic reasons. 

The second mistake I made was a bit larger, and I don't expect it to
be counted on the regrade since it required more changes.

This mistake was that I was I failed to check in my SetCellContents for formulas that the CellTable[name]'s 
contents were actually of Formula type. I originally had the ordering a little off too, such that I was
assigning the contents of a particular cell before adding the dependency. Duplicate cells, circular dependencies, and other 
illegal operations don't allow for the dependency to be created, but I had already created
a cell with the content in question. This caused me to fail the remaining two tests.

*See branch history of PS5, commit "Fixed last two tests" to see these changes. Since these 
changes are substantial and could be detrimental to my grade, I do not expect them to be part of the
regrade.
